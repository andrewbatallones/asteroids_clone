# Asteroids Clone

This will be my first attempt of making a completed game and I want to record the trials and things I learned.

## 3rd party assets used
- Sprites: Kenny Space Shooter https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-extension
- Sprites: Brackeys Health Bar Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfNP4Sc_iA&t=617s
- Music: Humble Bundle Game Creator Bundle https://www.humblebundle.com/software/game-creator-software


### What I learned
- Particle System
- UI and the TextMeshPro texts
- How to persist an object between scenes
- C# -> the ```static``` keyword and somewhat on how it works.
- The new controller system package

### Challanges and what I should do for next time
- I should gameplan the project before diving in. It's better to have some sort of big picture (use Trello)
- Better sorting of how I write code. This project's code was all over the place.
